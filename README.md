# üçø Popcorn

GPU programming is still too hard, and the current LLMs aren't helping much. We think we can build something better, an LLM that can actually write good GPU code.

We're doing this in public because,honestly it would be too hard to do otherwise. All our training runs, our conversations about what works and what doesn't, our infrastructure - it's all going to be open. If you want to help figure this out, join us.

## Where to Find Us
We mostly talk on discord.gg/gpumode in the popcorn channel. It's pretty casual - drop in when you can.

## What We're Working On

### Data
We're collecting every CUDA and Triton kernel we can find. We need more examples of good GPU code than what's currently out there.

### Infrastructure
We need compute - we're building tools to track progress and share results in real-time through Discord.

### Research
We're exploring what LLMs need to know about GPUs to generate effective code, and how to best sample and train them.

### Language Design
We're exploring new abstractions to simplify GPU programming and will promote successful approaches.
